TITLE   : Reinventing IT at scale: What Kyndryl CIO Kim Basile learned as Customer Zero
URL     : https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/corporate-news/transforming-it-insights-from-kyndryls-cio-kim-basile-on-navigating-modern-challenges/126074162

SUMMARY:
Kyndryl CIO Kim Basile describes a widening “ambition gap” in enterprise IT, where leaders overestimate their capabilities while underestimating structural barriers such as legacy infrastructure, technical debt, and weak data foundations. She highlights findings from Kyndryl’s Readiness Report, noting that although most executives rate their IT as best-in-class, far fewer feel prepared for disruption, and many are stuck in perpetual pilot mode with inconsistent data and insufficient focus on workforce readiness and culture. Basile outlines Kyndryl’s own post-separation transformation as “Customer Zero,” including drastic application and data warehouse consolidation, major platform modernization, and significant IT cost reduction, enabled by strong change management and a clear business-led approach. Customer demands for transparency and risk visibility led to the creation of Kyndryl Bridge, an AI-powered platform that provides customers with real-time, shared insight into asset health, vulnerabilities, and remediation actions. She stresses the importance of fully exploiting “batteries included” capabilities in core platforms like SAP, Workday, Okta, and Microsoft 365 through close IT–business collaboration, and of embedding governance, visibility, and skills development into AI and security strategies. Looking ahead, Basile emphasizes continuous monitoring, formal AI governance, and disciplined experimentation as essential to moving AI from experimentation to scaled, secure enterprise impact.

TITLE   : India’s AI mandate: From experiments to an intelligent enterprise
URL     : https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/artificial-intelligence/indias-transition-to-ai-from-experimental-pilots-to-full-integration/126056158

SUMMARY:
India’s large enterprises are prioritizing AI, but adoption remains uneven, with only 8% fully integrating AI into core operations while most are stuck in pilots or early experimentation. Sectoral progress varies: BFSI and IT-enabled services are relatively advanced, while manufacturing, healthcare, and retail often remain limited to tactical or front-end use cases and frequently conflate basic automation with true AI. Experts cited in the article note that organizations are converging on three near-term priorities—operations automation, customer service transformation, and marketing personalization—driven by specific KPI pain points rather than hype. A key execution challenge is scaling from pilot to production, where real-world data complexity, unclear ownership, and employee resistance can stall initiatives, underscoring the need for governance, retraining budgets, and structured change management. Case examples, such as Bandhan Bank, illustrate a phased approach to building AI-native operating models that embed intelligence into workflows, move toward predictive capabilities, and ultimately enable more autonomous operations while exposing underlying process and data weaknesses. By 2026, the article anticipates Indian enterprises will focus less on “doing AI projects” and more on measuring AI’s contribution to productivity, risk, and growth, with success framed in terms of value and “return on employee” rather than pilots or model accuracy alone.

URL     : https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/artificial-intelligence/revolutionizing-software-development-the-power-of-ai-driven-automation/125912460

SUMMARY:
AI-driven automation is presented as a key enabler for modern enterprises to accelerate software delivery, improve quality, and better align IT with business needs. The article describes a shift from basic task automation to intelligent, AI- and ML-powered platforms that can generate and refactor code, predict defects, optimize testing, and orchestrate deployments with self-healing capabilities. Organizations adopting these tools report faster release cycles, fewer defects, and reduced manual bottlenecks, while developers benefit from copilots, automated documentation, and personalized assistance that enhance productivity and reduce burnout. AI is also highlighted as a driver of “business-aligned DevOps,” giving leaders real-time visibility into cost, risk, and strategic KPIs, and supporting data-driven portfolio and scenario decisions. To scale these benefits, the article stresses the need for unified engineering platforms with embedded AI, strong governance and data quality, and workforce upskilling, positioning software delivery as a strategic growth engine within digital transformation.

TITLE   : Quantum computing could break Bitcoin by 2027: The end of crypto security?
URL     : https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/next-gen-technologies/quantum-computing-threatens-cryptocurrency-security-by-2027/125860132

SUMMARY:
Experts cited in the article warn that advances in quantum computing could undermine the cryptographic foundations of major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum as early as 2027, enabling attackers to decrypt private keys and manipulate transactions. The piece notes rapid progress by players like Google and IBM, referencing Google’s 2019 Sycamore result and estimates that a machine capable of breaking 256-bit encryption could emerge within a few years. Some security leaders, however, argue that timelines like 2027 are overly aggressive and emphasize that stronger standards (e.g., RSA 4096 and post-quantum cryptography, or PQC) can remain secure against foreseeable quantum capabilities. The article explains that cryptocurrencies rely on public-key cryptography, particularly elliptic curve schemes, which are theoretically vulnerable to sufficiently powerful quantum computers that can solve the underlying mathematical problems far faster than classical systems. Industry experts highlight that the main risk may fall on legacy or inactive wallets that cannot be migrated to quantum-safe schemes, even if newer systems adopt PQC. The article concludes that while post-quantum solutions are being developed and tested in next-generation blockchain projects, the transition window is limited and the crypto industry must proactively overhaul its security infrastructure to remain viable in a post-quantum era.

TITLE   : New DPDP regime strengthens data subject rights, redefines consent standards
URL     : https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/digital-security/dpdp-rules-revolutionize-data-rights-and-consent-framework/125498900

SUMMARY:
The article explains that India’s DPDP Rules, 2025 introduce a more stringent consent framework and expanded data subject rights, placing individuals at the center of data governance. Organizations must now provide clear, standalone, plain-language notices that specify what data is collected, for what purposes, and how it will be used, along with simple mechanisms for consent withdrawal, data correction, and complaint filing with the Data Protection Board (DPB). The rules formally recognize consent managers—registered entities responsible for collecting, recording, and managing consent—and impose special requirements for processing children’s data, including verifiable parental consent. Some security leaders note that while the direction of the regime is clear, several structural aspects, such as the role of the SDF and detailed operational guidance, remain undefined until the DPB becomes fully functional. For enterprises, the new framework will require redesign of consent flows, user interfaces, data lifecycle governance, and potentially new reliance on third-party consent management solutions, especially in consumer-facing sectors. Industry voices anticipate that the DPDP regime will evolve through enforcement actions and practical experience, leading to periodic refinements and more detailed regulatory expectations.

URL     : https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/digital-security/how-indias-dpdp-rules-reshape-risk-cost-and-governance/125433955

SUMMARY:
India’s Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Rules, 2025 have been formally notified, operationalizing the DPDP Act, 2023 and setting out concrete obligations and timelines for enterprises that handle digital personal data. The rules introduce a phased implementation over up to 18 months (12 months for consent managers), giving organizations time to build capabilities such as data mapping, consent management, and breach response, which is expected to particularly help smaller businesses. Compliance will increase operational costs, with legal and technology experts anticipating higher budgets for data governance, privacy-by-design architectures, consent and deletion workflows, and security tooling. Key requirements include comprehensive data mapping and classification, robust consent mechanisms, a two-tier breach notification regime with a 72-hour reporting window to the Data Protection Board, appointment of Data Protection Officers for Significant Data Fiduciaries, and annual Data Protection Impact Assessments and audits. Enterprises must also perform due diligence on software and algorithms used for data processing, review vendor contracts, and establish clear data retention and deletion policies, making privacy a continuous governance function rather than a one-time exercise. The article emphasizes that organizations should act proactively—treating compliance as both a risk-management necessity and an opportunity to strengthen trust and competitive positioning through privacy-by-design.

TITLE   : The end of POC theatre: CIOs shift from concept to value
URL     : https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/strategy-and-management/the-end-of-poc-theatre-cios-shift-from-concept-to-value/125268939

SUMMARY:
Indian CIOs are moving away from running numerous exploratory proofs of concept (POCs) and are instead demanding clear business intent, measurable outcomes, and stronger governance for any technology pilot. Leaders such as Pavan Goyal of Mphasis stress that POCs often fail not due to technology but because they are launched without a defined problem, success criteria, or business “hunger” driving them. CIOs including Anand Kumar Sinha of Birlasoft and Sriram Naganathan of HDFC ERGO are instituting stricter frameworks, requiring every POC to be tied to outcomes such as business impact, operational efficiency, compliance, and risk, and to be evaluated rigorously for adoption, value, and integration. In sectors with tight margins, executives like Manjunath Prasad of TVS Mobility emphasize that pilots are financial decisions, judged on revenue growth, cost optimization, and productivity, with limited tolerance for open-ended experimentation. Across organizations, culture and business ownership are identified as critical to turning pilots into scaled solutions, with innovation framed as “governed creativity” rather than ad hoc experimentation. The emerging CIO playbook focuses on fewer, more strategic pilots that progress from proof of concept to proof of value, with success defined by how many initiatives scale and deliver sustained business results.

SUMMARY:
India’s IT industry is undergoing significant workforce restructuring as major firms such as TCS, Infosys, and Wipro, along with global players like Accenture, Oracle, and IBM, implement large-scale layoffs while pivoting toward AI, cloud, and product-centric models. Despite these job cuts, the sector remains a key pillar of the Indian economy, with IT and ITeS exports reaching about USD 199 billion in FY 2023–24 and projected to rise to USD 224 billion in FY 2024–25. The article details substantial headcount reductions at leading firms—TCS (~12,000 roles), Infosys (~25,994), and Wipro (~24,516)—framed by management as restructuring for agility, cost efficiency, and future readiness. Experts cited are divided on whether layoffs are truly driven by realized AI efficiency gains or by board-level pressure to demonstrate value and cost discipline from AI initiatives, with some arguing that current value realization is still limited. A Wharton survey referenced in the piece indicates that 75% of companies report positive ROI from AI and nearly half of business leaders are using AI themselves, suggesting measurable benefits in some organizations. The article concludes that many enterprises may be adopting AI under uncertainty and fear of missing out, and stresses the need for more deliberate, strategy-led implementation that balances innovation with workforce impact.
