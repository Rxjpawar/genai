SUMMARY:
**Executive Summary (5‑6 lines)**  

- The newly enacted Data Protection and Digital Privacy (DPDP) regime expands data‑subject rights, granting individuals broader access, correction, erasure, and data‑portability powers.  
- Consent requirements are tightened: explicit, informed, and granular consent is now mandatory for processing sensitive personal data, with clear withdrawal mechanisms.  
- Organizations must implement robust consent‑management frameworks, conduct regular impact assessments, and maintain detailed audit trails to demonstrate compliance.  
- Non‑compliance attracts steep penalties, including fines up to 4 % of global turnover or INR 15 crore, whichever is higher, and potential criminal liability for willful violations.  
- The regime also establishes a dedicated Data Protection Authority to oversee enforcement, issue guidelines, and adjudicate disputes, signaling a shift toward stricter regulatory oversight of digital data practices.

SUMMARY:
**Executive Summary (5‑6 lines)**  
*The article discusses how chief information officers (CIOs) are moving beyond the “proof‑of‑concept” (POC) stage that has long dominated technology initiatives. It argues that the era of POC “theatre” is ending as CIOs demand tangible business outcomes, faster time‑to‑value, and scalable solutions. The shift emphasizes rigorous ROI measurement, stronger alignment with business units, and the adoption of governance frameworks that prioritize delivery over experimentation. Companies are urged to re‑engineer their innovation pipelines to focus on deployment, integration, and measurable impact rather than isolated pilots. The piece concludes with recommendations for CIOs to champion value‑centric roadmaps and for vendors to support end‑to‑end execution.*

SUMMARY:
- **Summary:** Emerging quantum computers may soon possess the computational power to solve the elliptic‑curve cryptography that secures Bitcoin transactions, potentially rendering the network vulnerable as early as 2027.  
- **Impact:** If exploited, a quantum attack could enable the creation of fraudulent signatures, allowing attackers to steal or double‑spend funds and undermine confidence in all blockchain‑based assets.  
- **Timeline:** Experts cite rapid advances in quantum hardware and algorithmic breakthroughs, projecting that a sufficiently powerful, error‑corrected quantum machine could be operational within the next five years.  
- **Mitigation:** The Bitcoin community is exploring post‑quantum cryptographic upgrades (e.g., lattice‑based signatures) and hard‑fork proposals to transition the network before a quantum threat materializes.  
- **Industry Response:** Major exchanges, custodians, and institutional investors are beginning to assess quantum risk, allocating resources to research and contingency planning to protect holdings.
