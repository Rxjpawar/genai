SUMMARY:
**Executive Summary**

- India’s newly enacted Data Protection and Digital Privacy (DPDP) regime expands data‑subject rights, granting individuals broader control over personal information, including the right to access, correct, erase, and port data.  
- The law tightens consent requirements: consent must be explicit, specific, informed, and freely given, with clear mechanisms for withdrawal and documentation of consent records.  
- Organizations must implement robust governance frameworks, conduct regular data‑mapping and impact assessments, and appoint a Data Protection Officer where required.  
- Non‑compliance triggers steep penalties—up to 4 % of global turnover or INR 15 crore per violation—prompting firms to accelerate privacy‑by‑design initiatives.  
- The regime aligns India more closely with global standards such as the GDPR, influencing cross‑border data flows and prompting multinational companies to reassess their data‑processing contracts and consent‑management platforms.

SUMMARY:
**Executive Summary**

- India’s new Data Protection and Data Privacy (DPDP) Rules impose a comprehensive fiduciary‑based regime, mandating organisations to appoint Data Protection Officers, maintain detailed data‑mapping inventories and conduct regular impact assessments.  
- Non‑compliance now carries steep penalties—up to ₹25 crore or 4 % of global turnover—driving a heightened focus on risk identification, mitigation and incident‑response capabilities.  
- The rules introduce stricter consent, purpose‑limitation and data‑localisation requirements, compelling firms to redesign data‑flows, renegotiate third‑party contracts and invest in secure storage infrastructure.  
- Governance structures must now embed privacy by design, with board‑level oversight and clear accountability lines, increasing the administrative burden and driving demand for specialised legal and tech talent.  
- While the compliance cost is significant—estimated at 1–3 % of annual IT spend for many large entities—the framework also creates a competitive advantage for firms that can demonstrate robust data stewardship to customers and regulators.

SUMMARY:
**Executive Summary**

- India’s IT giants are accelerating the shift from traditional outsourcing to cloud‑first, AI‑driven services, betting on higher‑margin digital contracts.  
- Massive automation and generative‑AI tools are prompting large‑scale workforce rationalisation, with firms announcing up to 15% headcount cuts in legacy coding and support roles.  
- To stay competitive, companies are investing heavily in reskilling programs, targeting 200,000–300,000 employees for AI, data‑analytics, and cloud‑architecture capabilities over the next 18 months.  
- The talent strategy now emphasizes hybrid skill sets—combining domain knowledge with AI fluency—while outsourcing low‑cost, routine tasks to offshore or gig platforms.  
- Early adopters report double‑digit revenue growth from AI‑enhanced solutions, but the transition creates short‑term labor market disruptions and pressures on profit margins.  
- Industry analysts predict a reshaped Indian IT ecosystem where a leaner, AI‑savvy workforce will dominate global digital transformation projects.

TITLE   : Quantum computing could break Bitcoin by 2027: The end of crypto security?
URL     : https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/next-gen-technologies/quantum-computing-threatens-cryptocurrency-security-by-2027/125860132?utm_source=exclusives_listing&utm_medium=exclusiveNews

SUMMARY:
**Executive Summary**

- New research suggests that advances in quantum computing could render Bitcoin’s elliptic‑curve digital signatures vulnerable as early as 2027, potentially allowing attackers to forge transactions.  
- The threat stems from Shor’s algorithm, which can efficiently solve the discrete‑log problem that underpins Bitcoin’s security model.  
- While today’s quantum hardware remains far from the required qubit count and error rates, rapid progress in both hardware and algorithmic optimization is closing the gap.  
- A successful breach would undermine confidence in all blockchain assets that rely on similar cryptography, prompting a market‑wide reassessment of crypto valuations and risk exposure.  
- Industry responses include proposals for post‑quantum signature schemes, hard‑fork upgrades, and migration timelines; however, coordination and backward compatibility pose significant challenges.  
- Investors and regulators should monitor quantum‑readiness roadmaps, allocate resources for protocol upgrades, and consider diversification strategies to mitigate potential systemic fallout.
